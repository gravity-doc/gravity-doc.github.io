# [Gravity Documentation](/README.md)
 This is the documentation for the **Gravity Cluster** of [Department of Astronomy (DOA)](http://astro.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

> [!TIP]
> - You can start from the [QuickStart here](/QuickStart)   
> - [CheatSheet here](/QuickStart?id=cheatsheet-📜) contains many useful commands   
> - Remember to acknowledge Gravity in your publications 👉  [Acknowledging Gravity Cluster](/?id=acknowledging-gravity-cluster)   
> - ❌**Never**❌ use `conda create/install` on *login01/computing nodes*, it will **destroy** the environment. You can only use it on **login02**. (see [more details here](/MISC/Issues?id=conda))
