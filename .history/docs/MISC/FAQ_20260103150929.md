## Permission denied

I got a **permission denied** error when trying to login with ssh

- your ip is **banned** (see below)
- you forgot to use *ssh-key* to login
- your `~/.ssh/authorized-keys` file on the server has the wrong permissions
  - `~/.ssh` should have permission `700` 
  - `~/.ssh/authorized-keys` should have permission `600`)

  contact the admin to fix the permission
 
You may be able to find out more information about the issue by adding the `-vvv` option to ssh, i.e., `ssh -vvv`.

## Forgot password

What if I forgot my password? 🔐

- [go to web authentication](https://jupyter.gravity.sjtu.edu.cn/auth/) to reset your password
- [send an **E-mail**](mailto:gravity-hpc@sjtu.edu.cn) with your *username*, we will help you to reset the password (it will take several hours maybe)

## Forgot ssh key

What if I lost my *ssh-key*? 🛡️

- [Send an **E-mail**](mailto:gravity-hpc@sjtu.edu.cn) to us, including your [**ssh public key**](/Basic/Login?id=_1-generate-ssh-key) and your **username**   

PS. You'd better use **@sjtu.edu.cn**, so that we can recognize who you really are 👀    

> [!TIP]
> You may be prompted for a passphrase when login with a ssh-key. This is the password you set-up to protect the key when generating your ssh-key. It is **different** from the password you use for jupyter.

## IP banned

What if my **IP** was **banned** ❌, so that I couldn't access **[JupyterHub](https://gravity.sjtu.edu.cn/)** or **ssh login**?

- [Check you IP here](https://ipinfo.io/), then contact us and tell us **your IP**

## Extend time of job

Can I extend my time of running PBS job? ⌛

- Sure! Contact us and tell us how much time you need.

## Add disk storage space

I want more **Disk storage space** 💾

1. contact your advisor, get his/her permission
2. contact admins to increase your disk quota

## Job never start

My PBS job is always waiting 😤

- Use `checkjob <JobID>` to check the **reason**.
- Use `showstart <JobID>` to see how much time is left to **start your job**.

## Job failed

My PBS job cannot run successfully 🙄

- Check your **error file** and **output file** such as `xxx.e<JOBID>` and `xxx.o<JOBID>`
- you can run your program on the **login nodes** first to test.

## WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!

when you **ssh log in** *Gravity*, if you meet Warning:

```text
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
08:98:a9:cc:f8:37:20:6b:b4:b1:6c:3a:15:b9:a9:92.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/lalala/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending key in /home/lalala/.ssh/known_hosts:2
RSA host key for gravity.sjtu.edu.cn has changed and you have requested strictecking.
Host key verification failed.
```

Don't worry, just delete the **specific row** of `~/.ssh/known_hosts` anderything will be OK      
From the *Warning*，you can see `Offending key in /home/lalala/.ssh/known_hosts:2`, so we just need to remove the **2nd row**.    

## binary file can not be executed

## source code string cannot contain null bytes

`binary file can not be executed` or `source code string cannot contain null bytes` 👉 [issue of conda](/MISC/Issues?id=conda)   

  > I am *so sorry* to tell you that your whole **CONDA** installation is destroyed. Cause this is a tricky bug🐛, we cannot fix it 😭.        
  >
  > You should re-install your conda, and **never** install/update any package on **login01**.

## Job logfile is empty

My job is *running* but my logfile is still **empty**?   

- This is probably because your log messages are being buffered on the computing node. You can try log into the computing node and check /var/spool/torque/spool/ to find the buffered logfile.
- `python -u xxxxx.py` will disable the buffer.

## FAQ: JupyterHub save errors with ipympl and large Matplotlib figures

### Q: I get `JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1` when saving a notebook. What does this mean?

This error indicates that JupyterHub received invalid or incomplete JSON data while attempting to save the notebook. In practice, this usually means that one or more cell outputs could not be serialized correctly during the save process.

---

### Q: Why does this only happen for notebooks with certain figures?

The issue is triggered by interactive figures created using the `ipympl` backend (`%matplotlib widget`). These figures embed their full interactive state directly into the notebook file. When the embedded state becomes too large, saving the notebook fails.

---

### Q: Why can I save a large figure, but saving fails after I set axis limits?

Setting axis limits (e.g. `set_xlim`, `set_ylim`) forces Matplotlib and `ipympl` to fully recompute and synchronize the figure state. For very large datasets (on the order of millions of points), this causes the widget state to grow dramatically, often exceeding what JupyterHub or the browser can reliably serialize and transmit. As a result, the save operation fails with a JSON parse error.

---

### Q: Which configurations are affected?

This issue is known to occur when all of the following apply:

- JupyterHub (especially when running behind a proxy)
- `ipympl` with `%matplotlib widget`
- Matplotlib figures containing very large datasets (≈ millions of points)
- Interactive widget figures are saved inline in the notebook

---

### Q: Is this a bug in my code or in the lab’s JupyterHub setup?

No. This is a known limitation of widget-based interactive plotting with large datasets. It is not specific to any individual lab configuration and can occur in standard JupyterHub deployments.

---

### Q: What are the recommended workarounds?

**Use `ipympl` only for lightweight interactive exploration**

Downsample data before plotting interactively:
```python
plt.plot(x[::500], y[::500])
````

**Switch to a static backend before saving**

```python
%matplotlib inline
```

Re-run the plotting cells and then save the notebook.

**Save large figures to disk instead of embedding them**

```python
plt.savefig("figure.png", dpi=150)
plt.close()
```

**Set axis limits before plotting (may reduce widget state size)**

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_xlim(...)
ax.plot(x, y)
```

**Clear outputs before saving**
Use:

```
Kernel → Restart & Clear Output
```

---

### Q: What practices should be avoided?

* Saving notebooks that contain `ipympl` widget figures with millions of points
* Using high-DPI settings with interactive widget backends
* Storing multiple large interactive figures in a single notebook
* Relying on autosave when `%matplotlib widget` is active

---

### Q: What should I use for interactive visualization of very large datasets?

For true interactivity with large datasets, consider visualization tools designed for scale, such as Datashader or WebGL-based plotting libraries. These avoid embedding massive serialized state directly into the notebook file.
